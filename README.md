# Onesimus
## 1. Description
Onesimus is a private learning tracker built with Django to help users stay motivated and keep good memories of their learning journey. Users can create topics, add entries, and track their progress in a secure, personalized space, making it easy to reflect, grow, and celebrate achievements.
### Situation:
Learning independently can be challenging, and many people lose motivation over time. We often face an uphill battle because learning requires consistent effort, and tracking progress can feel tedious and unrewarding. Recognizing that everything we know must be learned, I created a tool to simplify the process of tracking one’s educational journey.

### Task:
I wanted to create an application that helps people, including myself, keep a detailed log of learning topics, allowing them to create and manage entries for each topic privately. The goal was to make learning tracking easy, engaging, and a way to reflect on the knowledge gained over time.

### Action:
I developed Onesimus using Django, building it as a learning log platform that enables users to create unique topics, log entries for each topic, and track their progress privately. The design is focused on simplicity and privacy, providing a tool that motivates users to continue their learning journey without the distractions of a public-facing platform.

### Result:
Onesimus has become a personalized tool to document learning in a structured way. By providing a private and intuitive way to log topics and entries, it helps users stay motivated, see their progress, and look back on their achievements as a positive reinforcement for continuous learning.

## 3. Why the Name "Onesimus"?
The name Onesimus is inspired by its meaning: helper. This app is designed to be a supportive tool for anyone on a learning journey, helping them stay organized, motivated, and focused on their goals.
